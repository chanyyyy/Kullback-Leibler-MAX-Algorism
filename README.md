# Kullback-Leibler-MAX-Algorithm
An algorithm of Active Learning, applying in remote sensing image classification with SVM.
Import the libraries you need yourself, search for the function *topk_partition*, and test on your dateset.
This algorithm takes a long time to calculate on a large amount of data and has a mediocre effect, **For research and study only
